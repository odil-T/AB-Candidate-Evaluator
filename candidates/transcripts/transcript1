Interviewer (I):
Hi Kameron, thanks for joining us today. How are you doing?

Candidate (C):
Hi! Thanks for having me. I'm doing well, a bit nervous, but excited.

I:
Totally understandable. Let’s start with something simple—can you tell me a bit about your background and experience as a data analyst?

C:
Sure. So, I’ve been working as a data analyst for about 3 and a half years now. I started at a small e-commerce company where I mostly handled sales data in Excel and later transitioned into using SQL and Tableau. Then I moved to my current role at FinTech Solutions, where I work more closely with product and marketing teams. I use Python, SQL, and a bit of Power BI there.

I:
Great. Could you walk me through a recent project you're proud of?

C:
Yes. So, recently I led an analysis to identify user drop-offs in our onboarding funnel. We had a hunch that something was going wrong between step 2 and 3, but we didn’t have concrete data. I pulled event logs from our Snowflake database, did some preprocessing in pandas, and visualized the funnel in Tableau.

We found that over 40% of users were dropping after the ID verification step. I presented these findings to the product team, and they later simplified the ID verification screen. Two weeks after the change, the drop-off rate went down by around... 17%, if I remember correctly.

I:
That’s impressive. How do you usually ensure the data quality before starting your analysis?

C:
I usually start by checking for nulls and duplicates. I also do sanity checks, like comparing totals across different tables. Oh—and I sometimes run basic aggregations to make sure numbers line up with what the stakeholders expect. If something looks off, I’ll usually double-check the data source or talk to our data engineering team.

I:
What’s your proficiency level in SQL? And could you give an example of a complex query you’ve written?

C:
I’d say I’m advanced in SQL. For example, I once had to write a query to get cohort retention rates over time. It involved window functions, date truncations, CTEs… it was a bit messy at first—I mean, it took a few iterations to get right—but in the end, we had a reusable script that helped marketing track user retention weekly.

I:
Sounds good. You mentioned Python earlier. What libraries do you usually work with?

C:
Mostly pandas and matplotlib. I also use seaborn for nicer plots. Recently I’ve been learning plotly, and I’ve used scikit-learn a little bit, but mostly for basic clustering or regression, not really for production models.

I:
That’s fine. Do you have experience with A/B testing?

C:
Yes, somewhat. I’ve run a few A/B tests with the marketing team. We’d usually define the hypothesis, get the sample sizes, and monitor metrics like conversion rate. I used to calculate p-values manually with Python scripts, though recently our team’s been using an internal tool that does most of that.

Oh—but once I forgot to check if the groups were balanced at baseline. That kind of messed with the interpretation, but we caught it early. Learned my lesson there!

I:
(laughs) That happens. It’s good that you caught it. How do you usually communicate insights to non-technical stakeholders?

C:
I try to keep it simple and visual. I use dashboards or slides, and avoid jargon. For example, instead of saying "statistically significant," I’d say something like “this change is likely not due to chance.” I also try to tie the data back to business goals—like revenue or user growth—so people can relate better.

I:
Awesome. One last question: what areas are you trying to improve in professionally?

C:
Good question. I think I want to get better at storytelling with data. Sometimes I get too focused on the numbers and forget to structure my findings in a narrative. Also, I’m trying to learn more about dbt and data pipelines, to work more effectively with engineering.

I:
Great. Well, thanks a lot for your time, Kameron. That was a solid interview.

C:
Thank you! I appreciate the conversation—hope to hear from you soon.
